1. Preparing
To create debian package you need to install some tools. You can do this using command:
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential dh-make bzr-builddeb

After that prepare a tar.gz archive of the source directory. Archive should be called as <name-of-package>-<version>.tar.gz.
For example:
$ tar -zcvf solid-queue-1.0.1.tar.gz solid_queue

Package names must consist only of lower case letters (a-z), digits (0-9), plus (+) and minus (-) signs, and periods (.). They must be at least two characters long and must start with an alphanumeric character.
Then you should make such command: bzr dh_make <name-of-package> <version> <name-of-existing-source-archive>.tar.gz. For example:
$ bzr dh-make solid-queue 1.0.1 solid-queue-1.0.1.tar.gz
It asks type of package. Choose "l" for library package.

2. Editing debian directory
$ cd solid-queue/debian
This directory contains configuration files needed for debian packaging. Most of the files it adds are only needed for specialist packages (such as Emacs modules) so you can start by removing the optional example files:
$ rm *ex *EX

3. Build package
After editing configuration files use command:
$ debuild -us -uc
That's all!
